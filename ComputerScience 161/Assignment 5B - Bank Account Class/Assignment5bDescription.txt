 
Project 5.b

Write a class called BankAccount that has a string data member called customerName, a string data member called customerID, 
and a double data member called customerBalance.  The class should have a constructor that takes two strings and a 
double (name, ID, balance) and uses them to initialize the data members.  The data members of this class do not need to be set 
after they are initialized, so this class doesn't need any set methods - therefore the constructor will directly assign values 
to the data members instead of calling set methods to do it.  The class should have a get method for each data member.  It should 
have a method called withdraw that takes a double parameter and deducts it from the customer balance (the balance is allowed to be negative).  
It should have a method called deposit that takes a double parameter and adds it to the current balance.  
The BankAccount class might be used as follows:

BankAccount account1("Harry Potter", "K4637", 8032.78);
account1.withdraw(244.0);
account1.withdraw(3012.58);
account1.deposit(37.54);
account1.withdraw(1807.12);
account1.deposit(500.00);
double finalBalance = account1.getCustomerBalance();

Your functions should have the following names:
•	getCustomerName
•	getCustomerID
•	getCustomerBalance
•	withdraw
•	deposit

The files must be named: BankAccount.hpp and BankAccount.cpp
