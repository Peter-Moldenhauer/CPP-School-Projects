Project 5.a

Write a class called Box that has three double fields called height, width and length.  
The class should have set methods for each field.  It should have a three-parameter constructor that takes three doubles 
and passes them to the set methods to initialize the fields of the Box.  It should have a default constructor that uses 
the set methods to initialize each field to 1.  It should have a method that calculates and returns the volume of the Box 
and a method that calculates and returns the surface area of the Box.

The class declaration (interface) and the function definitions (implementation) must be in separate files - the interface 
or "header" file has a .hpp extension and the implementation has a .cpp extension.  As usual, all data members should be private.  
The Box class might be used as follows:

Box box1(2.4, 7.1, 5.0);
Box box2;
double volume1 = box1.getVolume();
double surfaceArea1 = box1.getSurfaceArea();
double volume2 = box2.getVolume();
double surfaceArea2 = box2.getSurfaceArea();

Your functions should have the following names:
•	setHeight
•	setWidth
•	setLength
•	getVolume
•	getSurfaceArea

The files must be named: Box.hpp and Box.cpp

About using multiple files:
1.	Make sure you've read and understood section 7.11.
2.	Box.hpp should have "include guards" as discussed on page 447 (use "BOX_HPP").
3.	Box.cpp needs to #include Box.hpp.  When you include your own .hpp files (header files), put double quotes around them instead of angled brackets.  (You should only #include .hpp files, not .cpp files.)
4.	When testing your program with your own main method, put it in a separate file (this is the "client" code) and give it a name with a .cpp extension.
5.	Your main method also needs to #include Box.hpp.
6.	If you named the file with your main method "boxMain.cpp", then you can compile your program with "g++ Box.cpp boxMain.cpp -o box".
