Assignment: Lab 5

This program compiles but does not run properly! There are a few errors in this program. 
This was a difficult assignment and I did not have enough time to work out all of the bugs. 
The ants and doodlebugs move on the grid but they do not starve/eat properly. 

I hope to finish and debug this program someday...
