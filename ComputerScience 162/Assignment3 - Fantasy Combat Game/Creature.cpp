/************************************************************************************************************
** Program Filename: Creature.h
** Author: Peter Moldenhauer
** Date: 10/30/16
** Assignment: Assignment 3
** Description: This is the .cpp file for the Creature base class. Since there are only pure virtual functions
** in the Creature class, there is no need to define any of the functions in the .cpp file.
** I kept this file just in case I added any non-pure virtual functions in this class and therefore would need
** to define them in this file here.
** Input: none
** Output: none
