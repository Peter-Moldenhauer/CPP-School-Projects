This is the Readme file for Lab4 that I built. Lab4 contains the files: makefile, main.cpp, functions.h and functions.cpp
To run the program, in the command line enter the directory that all of the files are in (all files must be in the same directory).
Type "make" into the command line and this will run the makefile which in turn will build and link the Lab4 program.
A new file "Lab4" should now be present in the directory. This is the executable file needed to run the program. 
Run the Lab4 file and the program will begin.

The program starts with a menu displayed to the user in which the user can select one of four options. 
Options one through three use various recursive functions and will require various input from the user.
Option four exits the program.
